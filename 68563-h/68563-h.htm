<p>Nappy saw his friend the Trashman coming
down the street.</p>

<p>“Look!” called Nappy, “I have a new
airplane—I have lots of airplanes.”</p>

<p>“Are you collecting airplanes?” asked
the trashman.</p>

<p>“What’s collecting?” asked Nappy.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m doing,” said the
trashman. “I’m collecting trash.”</p>

<p>“You have a wagon load,” said Nappy.
“Are you going to the dump now? I’ve
been waiting for you to come along.
Mother said I could ride with you if you’ll
let me. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the trashman. “Climb up.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i008.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“Mut wants to go, too.”</p>

<p>“Let him come,” said the trashman.
“That’s where you and I found that dog,
at the town dump, remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir,” said Nappy, “I wanted a dog
and you helped me find one. He’s a good
dog, too. And he likes to go to the dump.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i009.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“Well, here we are,” said the trashman.</p>

<p>Nappy climbed down off the wagon
and started looking around while the
trashman was dumping the trash. And he
saw a boy who was doing the same thing—looking
around.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Nappy. “Have you
found anything?”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i010.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“I found a brown jug,” said the boy.
“It’s cracked, but I can keep things in it.”</p>

<p>“I found a tin box,” said Nappy. “It’s
dented, but I can collect things in it.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Tommy,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, my name is Nappy. Let’s hunt
for things together; it’s more fun that
way.”</p>

<p>“Look! there’s a wagon wheel,” said
Tommy. “I saw it first so it’s mine.”</p>

<p>“Finders keepers,” said Nappy. “I see
a door knob and here’s a marble. I’m collecting
marbles. I have lots of them.”</p>

<p>“I bet I have more marbles than you
have,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“I bet you don’t,” said Nappy.</p>

<p>The boys kept on hunting together
until....</p>

<p>The trashman called, “Time to go
back.”</p>

<p>“Want to ride back?” asked Nappy.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>So Nappy asked the trashman if his new
friend could ride.</p>

<p>And the boys sat together on the back
of the trash wagon.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i012.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“I’ll trade you my door knob for
your wagon wheel,” said Nappy, as they
bumped along.</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” said Tommy. “My
big brother is building me a wagon and we
need another wheel.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Nappy, “I wish I had a big
brother. I only have a big sister. I’ll trade
you.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” said Tommy. “I
have two little sisters. They’re twins.”</p>

<p>“What are you boys talking about?”
said the trashman. “You can’t trade brothers
and sisters like you trade marbles.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed.</p>

<p>“We’re only kidding,” said Nappy.</p>

<p>When the trash wagon came to Nappy’s
house the boys got off.</p>

<p>“Thanks for the ride,” said Nappy.
“We collected lots of things. Come on,
Tommy, I’ll show you my marbles.”</p>

<p>Tommy waited on the front steps while
Nappy got his marbles. They were in a little
cloth bag with a draw string.</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Tommy. “That’s a neat
bag! Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“My big sister made it for me,” said
Nappy.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tommy, “maybe a big
sister would be a good trade for a big
brother after all.”</p>

<p>Just then Nappy’s sister came out of
the house.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“Hello, Sis,” said Nappy. “I have a new
friend. His name is Tommy. Will you
make a marble bag for him like the one
you made for me?”</p>

<p>“I was going out to pick blueberries,”
said Sister. “If you boys will pick the berries
I’ll make the bag.”</p>

<p>“It’s a trade,” said the boys. “Let’s go.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i016.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>So Nappy’s big sister got two little pails
for the berries, and a piece of cloth and a
string for the bag, and they all went to the
woods.</p>

<p>Nappy left Mut behind because he was
always chasing rabbits.</p>

<p>Sister sat under a tree to sew the bag,
and the boys started off to pick the berries.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a race,” said Nappy, “to see
which one can fill his pail first.”</p>

<p>“The first one back here with a full pail
wins,” said Sister.</p>

<p>So Nappy went one way and Tommy
went another way. And there must have
been more berries where Tommy went
because....</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i018.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Before long he was back with a pail full
of berries.</p>

<p>“I won,” said Tommy. “Here’s your
berries.”</p>

<p>“Here’s your bag,” said Sister, “but
where’s Nappy?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go find him,” said Tommy. “I
know the way he went.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said Sister, “I hope he’s
not lost!”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i019.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“He can’t be far,” said Tommy. “We’ll
find him.”</p>

<p>And they did find Nappy. He had
something in his arms—something he was
trying to hold on to—something wiggling.
The pail of berries was over-turned
on the ground.</p>

<p>“Look!” said Nappy. “Look what I
caught!”</p>

<p>“It’s a little raccoon,” said Sister.
“However did you catch him?”</p>

<p>“I put down my pail,” said Nappy, “to
pick some more berries, and when I looked
around, this little fellow was in the pail
with his tail sticking out ... so I grabbed
him. I’m going to keep him for a pet.”</p>

<p>“You have enough pets now,” said Sister.
“Besides, your dog wouldn’t like a
raccoon. Why don’t you let him go?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Don’t!” cried Tommy. “I
haven’t any pets. Oh, Nappy, I’ll trade
you anything I have for that raccoon!
Come to my house and you can choose
anything I have.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i021.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>So they all went to Tommy’s house.</p>

<p>And Nappy looked over the things
Tommy had.... There was a ball, and a
bat, and some skates, and some stilts, and a
wagon, and a drum.</p>

<p>“You mean I can choose <i>anything</i>?”
asked Nappy.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tommy, “anything except
the drum.”</p>

<p>“How about the stilts,” said Nappy.
“Will you show me how to walk on
them?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Tommy. “My big brother
can make me another pair of stilts. We’ll
have fun together.”</p>

<p>So the boys made the trade.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you want to trade your
drum, Tommy?” asked Nappy’s sister.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i023.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“Because my big brother plays the harmonica
and I beat the drum,” said Tommy,
“and you should see my little sisters
dance!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d like to see them dance,” said
Nappy’s sister. “Could we see them,
Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Tommy. “Come on.”</p>

<p>They found the twins in the back yard
making mud pies.</p>

<p>“You wait here,” said Tommy. “I’ll
get my big brother. They’ll drop those
mud pies and dance as soon as they hear
the music.”</p>

<p>Tommy went to get his brother.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they cute?” said Nappy’s big
sister.</p>

<p>“I hear music,” said Nappy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i025.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Out of the house came Tommy, beating
his drum, and his big brother, playing
the harmonica.</p>

<p>As soon as the twins heard the music
they dropped the mud pies and began to
dance.</p>

<p>“Oh, boy,” cried Nappy, “they can
<i>dance</i>!”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonderful act,” said Sister.
“Good enough for a show.”</p>

<p>“Let’s <i>have</i> a show!” said Nappy. “We
could fix up our barn like a theater
and....”</p>

<p>“I’ll make the costumes,” said Sister.</p>

<p>“Swell idea,” said Tommy’s big brother.
“I’ll fix up the barn.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i027.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“And I’ll train my raccoon to do
tricks,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“My dog can do tricks,” said Nappy.
“We can have lots of acts.”</p>

<p>“But the twins’ dance will be the best
in the show,” said sister. “We can call their
act ‘The Twirling Twins.’”</p>

<p>“Let’s get to work,” said Nappy.</p>

<p>Nappy’s sister took Tommy’s brother
to see the barn so he could start fixing it
up like a theater.</p>

<p>Tommy taught his raccoon to walk up
and down steps.</p>

<p>And Nappy learned to walk on stilts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i029.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Everybody worked——</p>

<p>Tommy’s big brother built benches in
the barn for the audience to sit on.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i030.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Nappy’s big sister made costumes.</p>

<p>She made dresses out of crepe paper for
the twins.</p>

<p>They looked exactly alike.</p>

<p>“You look just darling,” said Sister.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i031.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Then they all got together in the barn
to make plans for the show.</p>

<p>Nappy brought his old friend, Spike,
to the meeting.</p>

<p>“Spike wants to be in charge of tickets,”
said Nappy. “How much shall we
charge to see the show?”</p>

<p>“I think five cents will be enough,”
said Sister, “and I’ve made up a verse to
tell about it the way we did when we had
the pet show. Listen:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Come to see our ‘Saturday Show.’</div>
<div class="verse">See the Twirling Twins,</div>
<div class="verse">Music, stunts and fun galore....</div>
<div class="verse">You will surely cry for more</div>
<div class="verse">In the barn our show will be</div>
<div class="verse">Five cents is the entrance fee.”</div>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i033.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“That’s a good verse,” said Spike. “It
tells when the show will be, where the
show will be, and how much it costs to get
in. I’ll make copies of it and give one to
every kid in town.”</p>

<p>“Oh boy!” cried Nappy. “I just
thought of a great act for our show. You
kids just wait here. I’ll be back.”</p>

<p>Nappy ran down the street to Wong’s
Chinese Restaurant.</p>

<p>He found the Wong boys playing marbles
in front of their father’s restaurant.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Nappy. “How would
you boys like to be in a show? You can do
your tumbling act. We’re planning a show
in our barn now. Will you come and show
the other kids how you can tumble?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the Wong boys.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i035.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>And they went back to the barn with
Nappy, and did their stunts.</p>

<p>“That’s great!” said Tommy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i036.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“This is going to be the best show
ever,” said Nappy.</p>

<p>And it did turn out to be a great show
because all of the children worked to get
ready for it. They worked hard. They
worked together.</p>

<p>Nappy and Tommy helped build the
stage.</p>

<p>Nappy’s sister made a curtain out of
sheets, and the Wong boys hung it.</p>

<p>Then they had rehearsals while Spike
went around town selling tickets and at
last....</p>

<p>The big day came.</p>

<p>Spike stood outside the barn to collect
tickets.</p>

<p>Children came from all over town to
see the show.</p>

<p>“Have your tickets ready,” shouted
Spike. “Step right in—plenty of seats inside.
Have your tickets ready, please,
for the Saturday Show, the greatest show
on earth. See the Twirling Twins.”</p>

<p>“Step right up—have your tickets
ready, please.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i039.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Inside the barn, Tommy beat his drum
and his big brother played the harmonica.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i040.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The children took their seats and
clapped, and then....</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i041.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The curtain went up. Out on the stage
came the Wong boys, turning hand
springs.</p>

<p>They did somersaults forward and
backward while Tommy beat the drum.</p>

<p>They stood on their heads. They tumbled
all over the stage and ended up with
the smallest Wong boy standing on his
brothers’ shoulders.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah!” Shouts and cheers
came from the audience.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i043.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The next act was Tommy and his raccoon.</p>

<p>Tommy was dressed like a clown and
the raccoon climbed up on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Then the raccoon walked up and down
steps.</p>

<p>The audience clapped and Tommy
bowed and led his raccoon off the stage.</p>

<p>But when he came back, walking on
stilts, with his friend Nappy, what do you
think happened?</p>

<p>That raccoon came back on the stage
and climbed up the stilt, all the way up,
and sat on Tommy’s shoulder!</p>

<p>Then came the big act.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i045.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Nappy led his colt on the stage, and sitting on
the colt’s back were Tommy’s little twin sisters.</p>

<p>They were holding on tight because when
Tommy and his brother began to play——</p>

<p>The colt began to dance; then Nappy lifted
them off so they could dance themselves.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i046.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>How those twins danced! They kicked
and spun and whirled and twirled.</p>

<p>The audience shouted and cheered.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for the Twirling Twins!”</p>

<p>It was surely the best act of the show.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t the last one....</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i047.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The last act was....</p>

<p>Nappy and his dog.</p>

<p>Mut played ‘dead dog’ until ... he
heard the Star Spangled Banner and Nappy
waved an American flag....</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i048.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Then Mut stood up and saluted.</p>

<p>Indeed, everyone in the barn stood up
when they heard the Star Spangled Banner
and then....</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i049.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The curtain came down.</p>

<p>The actors bowed.</p>

<p>The audience clapped.</p>

<p>And that was the end of the show.</p>

<p>And that is the end of this story, too.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
